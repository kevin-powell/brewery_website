# brewery_website [Inspiring brewery templates]

Against the Grain prides itself on never being boring and really dives into the idea that drinking beer should be a fun, rowdy time. The four co-founders created this branding through inventive, fun beer tastes, names, artwork, brewery logo and, of course, Against the Grain’s website.

Using the same artwork the brewery’s cans wear and pictures of the team and past events, Against the Grain’s website is enticing, welcoming, and easy to navigate, showing consumers exactly what to expect when visiting Against the Grain – a good time
